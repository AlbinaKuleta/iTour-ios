About iTour app
The project weâ€™ll be making is called iTour, and is a travel app that helps sightseers plan their vacation sightseeing.
Users will be able to add a list of places they want to visit on their vacation, sort and search those destinations, then also add individual sights inside each place.
We have built this application in cooperation with xcode 15 and we have used the ios 17 simulator that after the execution of this code and after the runnig has been succesful,
the application has been installed inside ios 17 with which we have also seen the application itself how it works after many tests multiple.
We've designed the project specifically so that it covers a variety of core SwiftData techniques to give you a good grounding in how things work.
